# Introduction

We're building a robot that can travel across all sorts of terrain, from smooth plains to hilly landscapes, while creating detailed 3D maps of the area. 
Our robot isn't just about mapping the groundâ€”it's also equipped to measure temperature, humidity, and air quality, giving a full picture of the environment.

At the heart of our robot is the ESP32 microcontroller, which handles all the data processing and control tasks. 
We're using SG90 servo motors to ensure our robot can move smoothly and adapt to different terrains. 
With the help of a dual-band WiFi module from Texas Instruments, our robot can communicate its findings in real-time.

This project is all about combining cool tech and practical applications. 
By the end, we aim to have a robot that's not only a great mapper but also a valuable tool for anyone interested in environmental monitoring.
